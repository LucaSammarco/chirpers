# Chirpers - A Demo Application

## Introduction

Welcome to **Chirpers**, a demo application inspired by the `Laravel Bootcamp`. It showcases the power of the `PlanCraft` package in action. `Chirpers` emulates a social media platform where users can create and manage "Chirps" within teams. `PlanCraft` seamlessly handles user subscriptions and feature access based on their chosen plan.

## Billing and Subscriptions

### Viewing and Choosing Plans

Users can access the billing section to view and select their preferred subscription plan. The available plans are fetched using `PlanCraft` and displayed with their respective details.

### Subscribing to a Plan

When a user chooses a plan and initiates the subscription process, Chirpers leverages Laravel `Cashier-Stripe` to securely handle payment transactions. The selected plan's details are used to create a new subscription associated with the user.

### Switching Plans

Chirpers allows users to seamlessly switch between plans. The `switchSubscription` method updates the user's subscription with the newly chosen plan.

### Updating Payment Method

Users can easily update their default payment method through the billing interface.

### Cancelling Subscription

If a user decides to cancel their subscription, Chirpers provides a straightforward process. The `cancelSubscription` method ensures a smooth cancellation experience.

## Chirping Away!

With their subscription in place, users can start chirping within their teams. Chirpers utilizes Laravel's Gate and the `checkEligibility` method from `PlanCraft` to enforce limits on chirp creation, providing a seamless experience.
